<h3>Created by Evan Strauss</h3>

<p> Jumpin Jungle is a 2D endless jumper where you play as a monkey named Chimpa. Jump from vine to vine to prevent falling and survive as long as possible. Beware, though, some vines will be snakes and will try to drag you down. Avoid branches and swing away from lava to survive in this "endless jumper". The game will get faster as you progress and the obstacles will add up, so try as best as you can to keep your score. So jumpin the game and get ready to swing. </p>
