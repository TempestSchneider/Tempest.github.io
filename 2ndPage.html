<b> Genre </b> 
<br>
<p> Jumpin Jungle is a 2D endless game or an "infinite jumper" which is like an infinite runner, except you're jumping. </p>
<br>
<b>Description</b>
<br>
<p> Jump from vine to vine while escaping lava and avoiding branches. Try to jump to each vine/snake without falling down which will be hard because the snakes will fall down after some time.</p>
<br>
<b> Incentive </b>
<br>
<p> The incentive of the game is to reach the furthest distance and trying to beat your own or other people's scores. </p>
<br>
<b> Character </b>
<br>
<p> Chimpa is a monkey that lives in the Jungle. As he was living his normal days, a volcano erupted and lava started flowing throughout the jungle. Chimpa, one of the few survivors, is trying to escape with his life. </p>
<br>
<b> Competitive Analysis </b>
<br>
<p> Subway Surfers is a 3D infinite runner where you run away from a policeman and his dog as you collect powerups while dodging trains. The game gets faster as you progress like any infinite runner and my game, Jumpin' Jungle, is kinda inspired by this because 
you run away from something that's trying to get to you while dodging moving obstacles. While you are not running, it's still classified as an infinite runner. </p>
<br>
<p> Jetpack Joyride is a 2D endless game where you play as a guy named Barry who gained access to a Jetpack through illegal means. You try to survive as long as possible and get powerups to help you gain distance. Jumpin Jungle is a little similar to this because it's a 2D
endless game where you jump from vine to vine and trying not to get killed. </p>
<br>
<b> Game Engine </b>
<p> This "endless jumper" was made from Godot. </p>

<b> Availability & Target Audience </b> 
 The game is marketed more towards children due to its simplistic gameplay. Jumpin Jungle will only be available on the Google Play Store (Android devices).
